# Recipe for Success
These past few days have been pretty heavy. We've built a server to route our data. We built a database. We connected the database. We populated our VIEW by CONTROLLING what the user wants using our MODEL. When we finished yesterday's lecture, I was ecstatic. This pretty much makes me a legit, bonafide developer. Albeit, not a great one...but it's a start!

Let me try to break our lesson on express down.

From client side to server side, when a server pings our address of the internet, it hits our router. Our address is like a restaurant and our route is like a server, waiting to guide our user to their table. As a user is seated and presented with some menu data, as they order, what the server interprets is, 'We'd like the chef to make us X item'. The server handles this data and drops off a ticket to our chef. The chef then interprets the data and returns a food object. Sometimes, a user will say, 'I actually wanted steak, not chicken.' The server is ready for this, but must get the order to the chef. They are ALTERing the data by inserting new data about their order. The chef then interprets this data and returns a new food object, based on the changes that our user has indicated, all through our server.
