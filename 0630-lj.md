# Project Week II

I'm about to embark on the next set of project week stress. It was only a month ago that I was stressing about some silly html/css/vanilla javascript website. Static at that. This time, the chips are higher. We have jquery, node, backend, deployment, and so many other things that can go wrong. Not to mention trying to get the API information.

Already, I'm feeling the heat. The IG API only returns certain parts of data, so we're going to be creating some dummy accounts to fill the sandbox with some users. Should be pretty interesting...time to code!
