# Success is in the Struggle

It's only getting harder, and for some reason I'm really enjoying it. I'm beginning to realize that as we continue to go into 301 and 401 the smarter keep on getting smarter, and the 'not-so-smarters' are progressing as average.

Brian said that we had to persevere. So it's not time to look at other people and see how much success they are having. It's time to learn. It's time to keep going.

We've been learning about jQuery. It's a whole new ballgame. Lot's of moving parts, lots of new ways to organize. Even more so, having to talk about it to someone as they program what you say can be challenging. But I have found the experience of learning whether it's receiving instruction from my peers or giving that is both challenging and effective.
