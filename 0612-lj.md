# Carbo-Load
Today was orientation day for 301. I'm not going to lie. I'm pretty excited. I think 201 was a good place to start because it gave me an idea of how to organize for the material we are going to learn.

I'm most nervous about pair programming. It's not the idea that I can't do it, but I hope that whoever I partner with has an open mind, whether they are more advanced or not. I want it to be beneficial for both parties. I think our group is motivated though. We have some smart people in here.

Today we had our first lecture. 9-12 and then 1-4. Talk about a lot to digest. The main points we went over was a little appetizer on Agile Development, what we are going to be learning with MVC development, RWD and why it's important within the mobile age, and SMACSS. Even though I haven't spent a whole ton of time with SMACSS, I'm pretty excited because it's organized in a way that I like. I hope I understand all the concepts though.
