# Express Lane
This week felt more heavy than our first week. We covered a lot more ground than I thought we could cover. Let's recap. AJAX, intro to node, intro to express, intro to postgres. Sounds like we just did a crash course on being a full stack developer.

One of my concerns is that I have is that since we're looking at code and trying to troubleshoot, I'm not having enough hands on time writing code. It's a weird feeling. Right now, I feel like my conceptual and theoretical knowledge is increasing, but my code writing abilities pretty static.

We had our 101's with Brian this week. He says this is pretty normal. We need to approach this in a very high view, and the nitty-gritty in 401. We'll see the projects go though as we start thinking about it this week.
