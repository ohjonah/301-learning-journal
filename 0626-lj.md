# Page Break
This weekend was a productive weekend. On Friday, I had left lecture, like many of my peers, dejected and burdened by that week. To be honest, last week was one of the harder weeks of my CF career so far. I felt like, even though there were many victories, there was a deep valley of knowledge that needed to be gained through that week. On Friday, it just so happened that it culminated to everything that I should know, that I didn't know.

I took the weekend going through the different array methods that we had gone over. Map. Filter. Reduce. I started working with them a little bit. When I came in this morning to finish, arguably the hardest portion of the lab, Allan and I handled it with relative ease, although it took quite some time.

I'm excited to further learn the applications of page.js. Right now it seems very similar to express routing patterns, so syntactically, it has been easier to digest.
