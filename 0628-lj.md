# A Rock and a Hard Place

We're at this point where we want to implement all these great ideas, but we have no clue what's possible. Think about it. None of us have experience and we don't know what problems can be solved using our new super powers. We're like Clark Kent before he went through his Superman puberty.

I think after this project, we'll have a better idea of what we are able to accomplish. I heard from other 301 projects that you end up catching the API bug after project week. That's what I'm looking forward to. But for now, we'll have to be happy with the ideas we don't find amazing.
