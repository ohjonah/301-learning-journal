# Hotline Bling
Today we learned about AJAX and callback functions. Today, I felt like a real developer. I was making calls to a faux-api and returning data in JSON.

I also think that I'm retaining a lot more information that I thought I was. It was great working Nick today for our lab. We had a very fluid pair programming session and talked to each other in seemingly correct vernacular.

I'm excited to see what we are going to do this week, because I think we got a Costco sized sample for the amount of groceries that you actually end up getting when you go to Costco. I'm sure I'll have more to write as we progress this week.
