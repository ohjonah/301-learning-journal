# Don't Worry, j Query!
This week was all over the place. There were times where I felt like I had a good feel for what I was doing and other days where I felt extremely lost. I'm understanding after this weeks lab that jQuery is used to grab elements for the DOM, traverse it, and manipulate the DOM. What's more confusing is how to use jQuery to be dynamic and listen for events that are dynamic in the DOM.

When we went over the last lecture/workshop, my mind just about blew up. I need to take some time to really work through it and trace through the prototype methods. I think after that, implementing it into my sandbox portfolio may help cement it. However, it was a lot to digest.

I'm looking forward to this next series on APIs. It's what legit devs do. Make calls. Parse JSON. Do Stuff.
